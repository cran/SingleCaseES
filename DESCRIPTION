Description: 
  Provides R functions for calculating basic effect size indices for 
  single-case designs, including several non-overlap measures and parametric 
  effect size measures, and for estimating the gradual effects model developed 
  by Swan and Pustejovsky (2018) <DOI:10.1080/00273171.2018.1466681>. 
  Standard errors and confidence intervals (based on the assumption that the outcome 
  measurements are mutually independent) are provided for the subset of effect sizes 
  indices with known sampling distributions.
